# Kattis Problem Archive
## About
These are my solutions to Python programming exercises from the [Kattis archive](https://open.kattis.com/). My solutions are based on my knowledge in Python from the course *Programming for Mathematicians* at Stockholm University, Sweden. Note that there are often several ways to solve a problem, and I am open to suggestions/questions!
